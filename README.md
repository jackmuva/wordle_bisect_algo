# wordle_bisect_algo
## About
This is a fun project I did in a few days to see if I could write an algorithm that solves wordle in an optimal way. It's based off the gradient descent algorithm, where I'm constantly trying to cut the list of possible words into distinct groups, where the presence/lack of presence of a letter creates those groups.
